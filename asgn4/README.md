# CS335 Assignment 1

## Prerequisites

* g++ (we tested with g++ 7.2.1)
* bison (we tested with bison 3.0.4)
* flex (we tested with flex 2.6.4)

## Instructions

``` shell
$ cd asgn4
$ make
$ make (render FNUM=1 | clean)
```

Note: some test cases are intentional failures to highlight our error handling capabilities (we print warnings and errors as needed).

## Acknowledgements:
We took some  test cases from the Golang examples (repository)[https://github.com/golang/go/blob/release-branch.go1.4/test/ken/] and the GoByExample (website)[https://github.com/golang/go/blob/release-branch.go1.4/test/ken/].
